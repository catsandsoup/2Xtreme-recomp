<!-- /retcomm-readme-metrics -->

Static recompilation of **2Xtreme** built on
[psxrecomp](https://github.com/mstan/psxrecomp) and
[recomp-ui](https://github.com/RetroPortingToolKit/recomp-ui).

**Goal:** a player downloads a Mac app, picks their own 2Xtreme disc once, and
is skating within a minute with a controller, in menus that feel like part of
2Xtreme. Project rules: [docs/PRODUCT_RULES.md](docs/PRODUCT_RULES.md).
Current audit and plan: [docs/M1_AUDIT.md](docs/M1_AUDIT.md).

**Status:** work in progress, not yet playable as a standalone app. There are
no releases yet.

## Retro Launcher

You can run this title **standalone** (download the release zip, point it at
your disc, play), or manage installs, updates, and disc/BIOS wiring with
**[Retro Launcher](https://github.com/RetroPortingToolKit/Retro-Launcher)** —
the Retro Compilation Manager hub for self-compiling recomps.

Retro checks for updates, installs the prebuilt release zips, and automates
BIOS/ROM/save plumbing so you are not stuck repeating each game’s first run by hand.

## Legal

You must own the original game. Disc images under `disc/` are gitignored and
must never be committed. Retail BIOS dumps are not redistributed and no C
derived from one may be committed; releases run on the bundled MIT OpenBIOS.

`generated/` (the recompiled game C) is **not** committed and never will be:
it is derived from the disc. It is produced locally from your own disc
(`psxrecomp_cli.py generate`, below) and the goal is for the app to do this
for the player at first run. See [docs/PRODUCT_RULES.md](docs/PRODUCT_RULES.md).

Default app icon: `assets/psxrecomp.ico` (and `.png` / `.svg`) — Retro-themed controller mark from `psxrecomp/assets/`. Windows builds embed it via `APP_ICON`.

Optional box art under `launcher_assets/img/` may come from
[libretro-thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails)
(`Named_Boxarts`); see `BOXART_SOURCE.txt` when present.

## Quick start (dev)

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
./psxrecomp/tools/ci/build_emitters.sh
git -C psxrecomp apply ../patches/psxrecomp/*.patch   # local runtime changes
python3 psxrecomp/psxrecomp_cli.py generate \
  --config game.toml --project-root . --disc disc/<your>.cue   # stays local
cmake -S . -B build-release -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-release --target psx-runtime
```

Releases: none yet. Because the game C is generated from the player's disc,
releases will ship the app and toolchain, not the compiled game.

## Symbols

Progressive map: `symbols.toml` → `python3 tools/sync_symbols.py` →
`psx_symbols.h` (`PSX_FN_*`). See `psxrecomp/docs/SYMBOLS.md`.

## Framework pins

Submodule gitlinks (`psxrecomp`, optional `recomp-ui`, nested `recomp-net`)
are authoritative. `framework_pins.txt` is an optional scaffold snapshot;
release CI logs SHAs with `record_pins.sh` but builds whatever the gitlinks
resolve to. Bump submodules deliberately — do not float on `main`/`master`
in release CI.
